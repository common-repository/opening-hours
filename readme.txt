Opening hours for your business, a joy to manage and highly customizable. Conditional excerpts; conditional/replacement text; Structured Data for SEO.

== Description ==

Control all aspects of your business’ opening hours with this very easy management tool with multiple display options and conditional text while open or closed with renewed content upon status changes.

= Demo: =

We have a comprehensive showcase of the shortcode’s design and functionality on our [Demonstration Website](https://demo.designextreme.com/were-open/).

= Recommendations: =

*   If populating from Google, I would recommend [setting your business in Google](https://business.google.com) and finding your [Place ID](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id).
*   And if used more than once, create a [Google Billing Account](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing) to receive your substantial free API Request allocation.

*This is just my second public plugin and [all comments](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/we-are-open/) are very welcome. It is a sister plugin to [Reviews and Rating – Google My Business](https://wordpress.org/plugins/g-business-reviews-rating).*

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/opening-hours` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ screen in WordPress
3. Use the **Settings**→**We’re Open!** screen to configure the plugin
4. Insert a shortcode into any page, post or use the widget to place throughout your website


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Nothing is showing up, what is wrong? =

You’ll need to go to **Settings**→**We’re Open!** to set some required settings before you can start using this plugin on the front end.

= The current open or closed status is sometimes wrong. How do I fix this? =

This can happen when the time zone in WordPress is not set correctly. It is very important that your time zone is accurate. Go to Settings→General; set your time zone to the nearest city that shares your time zone (rather than GMT +/– hours). Check the current time using the conditional text shortcode: *[open_text]%now%[/open_text]*.

= I use a caching service. How can I ensure my opening hours are current? =

You can refresh content using the shortcode parameter: *update="immediate"* to force an immediate update to the displayed information.

= The time is out by an hour. What should I try to fix? =

A common mistake is to set the time zone in WordPress using hours from GMT when it’s more reliable to use your geographic location (e.g. Europe/Paris). Using the geographic location option considers daylight saving time.

= How can I keep the opening hours with Google My Business current? =

Enable **Structured Data**. It works very well to inform Google My Business of your complete opening hours, including special opening hours and temporary closures.

Alternatively, you may wish to update your opening hours from Google My Business using the Places API (New). This method requires a Google API Key and Place ID (single location) and doesn’t consider special opening hours or temporary closures.

= Can I use my own words for “closed”, “today”, “tomorrow”, “midday”, “midnight” or label the actual holidays? =

Yes, you can set most of these words in the settings or all of these using a shortcode parameter. Labels to replace the day names or dates in special opening hours are available in the Dashboard.

= Can I have my holiday opening hours appear only when relevant? =

Yes, this is possible by using the [`[open_special]`](https://demo.designextreme.com/were-open/#open-special) shortcode. Enclose your special opening times, and any HTML such as a heading, to have this appear only when it’s needed.

= Is this plugin fully GDPR compliant? =

Yes.

= How do I get a Google API Key if I want to populate or synchronize from my Google My Business listing? =

All the details for collecting your Google API Key can be found using our [visual guide](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/we-are-open/#api-key-guide).

Once your *Project* is set, you will need a new *API Key* with access to **Place API (New)**. As a restriction, set your host’s **IP Address** (not your website’s URL). A more detailed guide is available in the Additional tab of Settings→We’re Open!.

The Google API Key is required for this plugin to load the data from the Google Places API (New).

= How do I find my Place ID? =

You can locate your unique *Place ID* using Google’s: [Place ID Finder](https://developers.google.com/places/place-id). Only specific locations are supported; not coverage areas.

= Can I have multiple sets of opening hours? =

Sorry, this is not supported by this plugin with only one set of opening hours available. [Requests](https://designextreme.com/wordpress/we-are-open/#support) to extend this functionality are welcome, but there is no time-line for this development.

In order to retrieve your opening hours from Google My Business, you will need a Google API Key, locate your Place ID and set your billing information. With the Billing details, you’ll receive a substantial *free* allocation, ample enough to use this feature for free.
